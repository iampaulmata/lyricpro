# Infrastructure

This directory will store infrastructure as code assets (Docker Compose, Terraform, deployment scripts) for hosting Supabase and the LyricPro backend services.

## Planned Assets

- `supabase/` – Self-hosted Supabase configuration and environment templates.
- `ci/` – Continuous integration workflows for automated testing and deployment.

> The Supabase Docker templates will be added once the schema stabilizes and secrets management conventions are finalized.
